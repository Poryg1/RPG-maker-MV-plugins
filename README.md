# RPG-maker-MV-plugins
An unified repository for my RMMV plugins. 

# Plugin list
Input blocker - blocks all input movement upon turning on a switch.  
Fixed leader - cosmetic plugin working only with no followers. Your map "leader" will work the same on map regardless of your party leader.  
Extra event pages - allows you to add extra event pages from an event on a dummy map to an event on a real map, allowing you to effectively exceed the 20 event pages per event. Also, you can freely mix together a couple of events and even create event variations based on the event pages you copy.  
Event spawner - Requires the Extra event pages plugin. Spawns events. Unlike GALV's event spawner however, this plugin directly influences $dataMap and serves more as an utility plugin to streamline events addition and edit. Also allows you to save the final version of $dataMap into the data map file with both a notetag and a plugin command.  
Extended text manager - a plugin that allows you to customize the terms midgame or create completely new custom terms.
